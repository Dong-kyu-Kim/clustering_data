# clustering_data

We started first with restaurant review data pulled from Kaggle and our main objective was to develop and implement an unsupervised learning model to analyze and separate the data into two clusters for comparison. Ultimately with further iterations we would like to have the model determine "Go" or "Don't Go" for each restaurant. 

Using Jupyter Notebook we created the unsupervised model, loaded in our data set, standardized the data, and exported the resulting clusters into a sql file and into Tableau for visualization. 

Each of our visualizations aim to show the similarities and difference between the two clusters to begin to deterime which clusters would be "Go" vs. "Don't Go".
